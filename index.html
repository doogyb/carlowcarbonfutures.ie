        <h1>.   About</h1>
        <p>
        Carlow Carbon Futures Vol. 2 is the second instalment of TUDublin’s 4th Year Architecture students’ work on a county-wide level in developing architectural projects with critical position on climate action. This took the form of group research, analysis, and strategies for areas of interest within Co. Carlow. Split between two semesters, students were tasked with developing their own briefs based on their ecological stances and leanings. The driving force behind many of the approaches taken were the UN Sustainable Development Goals, which serve as a blueprint for a better and more sustainable future for all.  
<p>
  The work of Semester 1 centred on developing group masterplans with a strong zero carbon imperative along with a building or piece that infrastructure that addresses the climactic issue they had identified. Semester 2 saw the class re-examining of existing housing typologies and proposing radical new ways of living. Strategies of sustainability and resilience remained central to these projects with many integrating housing as a puzzle piece of their semester one work. This strong link between living and the ecological themes that had been examined previously aimed to square the circle and propose a different mode of existence in the modern world. An  emphasis was also place on implementing circular economic systems of production, growth and re-use. Different territorial scales from the county to the townland, and the building to its material components, have been addressed – attempting to leave no stone unturned in the quest for a carbon-positive future for Carlow.
